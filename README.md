# Hydraulic_fracking_fluid_selection
Hydraulic fracturing fluid selection based on Petrel &amp; Kinetix modeling


## Summary

Horizontal well technology coupled with multistage hydraulic fracturing enabled economic production
from unconventional reservoirs. However, even with application of those advanced technologies, the
recovery from these reservoirs is far from optimal. Major reasons for suboptimal reservoir recovery are
high levels of reservoir heterogeneity and non-optimal hydraulic fracture jobs. The objective of this study
is to addressthe suboptimal hydraulic fracture design problem. Hydraulic fracturing optimization is a wide
topic and there are different mechanisms in a play and a range of design variablesto consider and optimize.
High resolution modeling studies are one of the tools that enabled understanding of the mechanism of
hydraulic fracturing and improving treatment designs. In this work, state of art hydraulic fracturing
simulator is used to model the hydraulic fracture propagation in a field-like unconventional model with
one horizontal well. Comparative study using three different fracturing fluids, namely slickwater, linear
and cross-link gel, is done to select the best fracturing fluid and optimize hydraulic fracturing job. Results
show that fractures created by cross link gel fracking fluid led to largest length distributions, propped and
total fracked areas, followed by linear gel and slickwater.
